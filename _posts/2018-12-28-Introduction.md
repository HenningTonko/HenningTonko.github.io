title: Introduction to TempleOS and HolyC
---

I have recently discovered the operating system "TempleOS" made by Terry A. Davis.
He worked on it for over a decade while battling schizophrenia. He believed God had instructed him to build The Third Temple as prophesized in the Bible. Not only did he make an operating system based around God, he created his own version of C called "HolyC". It has some features found in C++, with some syntax borrowed from Pascal. I looked around the internet to try and find a definitive tutorial or guide for using HolyC or TempleOS. While I was able to find the archives of Terry's livestreams, [which can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEPEqMr199q3iRTwToIotVA) (quick note: Terry often uses terrible language in his livestreams such as the n-word and other racist profanity so viewer discretion is extremely advised), but I could not find an easy to consume and succinct source of information on commands and HolyC syntax and operations. This is what I intend to provide.

The following posts on HolyC and TempleOS will be updated over time after their inital release. I may not go too deep into the technical aspects of some of the topics initially, if at all, but I will continue to update the posts with new information or corrections when I become aware of them. I hope to write in a way that enables people to be able to explore and use TempleOS to its fullest potential.

If you wish to download and try out TempleOS for yourself you can download it from the official website found [here](https://www.templeos.org/Downloads/). The file you will want is called "TOS Distro.ISO".

I will be running it using VMBox which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). TempleOS was extremely easy to get up and running using VMBox.

As for an actual "physical" install, I can't do that quite yet. TempleOS requires a CD-Drive and PS2 ports on the machine it is installed on. I have access to neither of those. It is a goal of mine to own a computer that has TempleOS as its sole operating system, but as a poor college student this will just have to wait.
